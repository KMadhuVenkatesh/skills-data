and motivation to solve problems in large companies, especially real estate
companies and web portals. I'm proud of what I’ve done so far at ReclameAQUI.

Professional Experience

Stanzak Solutions LLC
Software Engineering Consultant

Owner and sole consultant. Projects include the following:

2021 &  present

I  developed  an  ASP.NET  Core  6  web  application  for  New  York  State  residents  applying  for

rental  assistance  as  well  as  an  internal  application  for  State  employees  to  process  assistance
applications  and  payments.  I  worked  closely  with  the  product  team  to  manage  client
expectations,  refine  scope,  clarify  business  requirements,  and  develop  technical  assessments

while adapting to quickly evolving product requirements and aggressive timelines.

I developed an ASP.NET Core 7 job scheduler that ingested and transformed data from multiple

source  systems,  used  by  several  municipalities  to  prepare  budgetary  reports  on  assistance

programs  for  the  US  Treasury.  I  worked  closely  with  the  clients  performing  extensive  parallel

testing and data analysis in order to identify gaps in legacy processes and apply remediations to

the  new  automated  process.  I  also  created  a  containerized  local  development  environment  to

effectively coordinate different source systems for multiple tenants.

I  managed  the  migration  of  an  ASP.NET  Core  application  from  version  2.1  to  6.0,  with  a

particular  focus  on  managing  breaking  changes  between  Entity  Framework  and  dependent

GraphQL  libraries.  As  part  of  this  migration  work,  I  analyzed  release  notes,  source  code,  and

documentation  for  problematic  libraries;  iteratively  applied  recommended  migrations,  and

performed extensive integration testing to ensure regressions were not introduced. During this

process, I continually advised the client on migration challenges, required architectural changes,

and ongoing risks of current dependency choices.

I  served  as  architect  for  a  client  in  the  health  insurance  industry  on  a  .NET  Core  7  greenfield

project  to  manage  data  flows  between  internal  and  external  systems.  As  part  of  this  project,  I

created  an  initial  proof-of-concept  that  included  REST  API  microservices;  an  Angular  15  web

application;  containerized  local  development  environments;  HTTP  and  Kafka  message  broker

clients;  and  standardized  data  access,  configuration,  and  middleware  libraries.  Additionally,  I

mentored the team on architectural patterns and contributed to standardized CI/CD pipelines.

Nurx

Staff Engineer

2020 &  2021

I  served  as  a  technical  leader  for  a  YCombinator  Series  C  startup  in  the  healthcare  sector,  with

domain focuses in data access, GraphQL APIs, and systems integration. In this role, I collaborated

closely  with  the  product  and  marketing  teams  to  develop  solutions  in  Node.JS  (with  TypeScript)

and Ember to improve patient conversion and engagement via custom integrations with marketing

platforms and A/B experimentation around features and UI.

RenPSG
Lead Engineer

2020

I led a cross-functional team focused on financial systems integrations and backend services used
by  clients  in  the  financial,  banking,  and  philanthropy  sectors  to  manage  over  14  billion  dollars  in
assets. I proactively engaged with executive leadership and product development teams to allocate

resources, assess technical risks, and refine requirements; I worked closely with business experts to

ensure new services supported business growth areas as well as legacy use cases; and I mentored
junior engineers on backend architecture, microservice patterns, and professional practices.

Professional Experience

(continued)

I played a key role in architecting a backend service layer composed of REST and GraphQL APIs, all built on .NET Core. I made significant contributions

to this service layer in the domains of data access, data modeling, middleware, API design, and systems integration. Additionally, I developed unit testing

libraries  to  consistently  test  common  service  behaviors  and  an  integration  testing  framework  for  testing  API  contracts  and  service-to-service

interactions.

RenPSG

Senior Software Engineer

2019 &  2020

I developed, tested, and maintained an ASP.NET MVC web application used by clients in the financial, banking, and philanthropy sectors to manage over

14  billion  dollars  in  assets  used  for  charitable  giving.  I  worked  closely  with  clients  to  manage  automated  data  flows  between  our  system  and  client

systems, ensuring that unique client requirements were integrated into our systems in a way that was extensible, maintainable, and documented.

Defense Finance and Accounting Service (Department of Defense)

Senior Software Engineer / Senior Business Analyst

2018 &  2019

I  developed  financial  and  accounting  software  for  one  of  the  largest  service  providers  in  the  world.  I  played  a  key  role  in  an  agency-wide  effort  to
convert legacy applications to more sustainable platforms and systems architectures that supported greater security, timeliness, and audit requirements. 

Notable projects include the following:
• a high-visibility accounting application that reconciles multiple data feeds comprising over 650 billion dollars in annual cash expenditures;
• an application that processes current and retroactive life insurance payments for military servicemembers serving in combat zones;
• and an application that provides auditing and reporting tools on network access controls.

Defense Finance and Accounting Service (Department of Defense)

Software Engineer / Business Analyst

2016 &  2018

I developed software applications to support process automation, research activities, reporting, and auditing for one of the largest payroll providers in
the world (750,000+ employees).

Notable projects include:
• entry-point application and associated data store used to manage security, deployment, and version control of other applications;
• application used to calculate and process taxes and other deductions on an entitlement granted to employees of the Executive Office of the President;
• research tool used by security personnel to manage user access to payroll system and prepare reports in response to data calls.

I  also  served  as  technical  advisor  in  enterprise-level  meetings  aimed  at  reviewing  systems  requirements,  including  business  process  standardization
across multiple payroll offices.

Indiana University Press

Production Manager

2015 &  2016

I  managed  the  print  and  electronic  production  and  distribution  of  twenty-five  academic  and  professional  journals  and  served  as  the  primary  liaison
between the publisher and editorial teams, contractors, and vendors. Additionally, I developed internal applications to automate editing, publishing , and

financial workflows.

Open Source Contributions

Microsoft OData / WebAPI
https://github.com/OData/WebApi/pull/1895

I contributed to Microsoft’s WebAPI implementation of the Open Data Protocol (OData) for REST APIs to fix a bug in metadata generation that caused

runtime exceptions under certain conditions.

https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/pull/848
https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/pull/976

I made two contributions to an HTTP client generation library to fix a regression in serializing dictionary properties with nonstring keys and to fix a bug
in serializing collection properties in query parameters.
